# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
*I am most proud of my problem solving and research! As I continued through the final practice I felt myself get more cmfortable with executing the code. Also, the process of researching became a lot more efficient and I was easily able to find the answers I was looking for in addition to learning some extra tips.*
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
*From what we've done in this practice, methods seem to make the code a lot cleaner and it allows code reusability. I can also see how it makes it easier to break more complex programs into smaller portions.*
